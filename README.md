A frisbee based big trak clone want-to-be

Current Hardware:
* Arduino Mega2560 + Motor Shield
   
* Two motors mounted under a frisbee. Ripped from R/C cars,
  Including gearboxes. These are connected via the shield.
* Hall effect sensors (one per motor)
 Using the 3144. A pull up resister is needed,
 The internal SHOULD work. YMMV
* Two 4x4 keypads for programming input.
* AA battery box ripped from the R/C cars.
 This includes the on/off switch.
 This powers the motors.
* 9v battery to porwe the Arduino itself.
   
Needs:
* Display of some sort to help with programming
 when the system is NOT connected to a serial monitor.
* sd card to store programs on.
* Radio to communicate w/o wires
* Charging station.
* Lights! Sound! Weapon grade laser! SkyNET!
